# Equitable Charging-stationg Site Recommendation
This is project of finding the equitale charging-station sites


## Environments:

The code works well with [python](https://www.python.org/) 3.9.13,  
and **[osmnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx)  1.2.2**.

tqdm, bintrees, plotly are also required

Some scripts (for map matching) require cygwin and python 2.7

## Pipeline:

1. Input: 
   (1) an origin-destination (O-D) pair lat-lon coordinates; 
   
   (2)  the mass of the truck; 
   
   (3) the day of the week;
   
   (4) the time of the day.# ecoRouting
This is project of eco-efficient path selection given an origin/destination pair and a bounding box.


## Environments:

The code works well with [python](https://www.python.org/) 3.8.8, 
[pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) 1.8.1, 
and **[osmnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx)  0.16.1**.
